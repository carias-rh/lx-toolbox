# Automated lab environment creation
This project uses ansible and selenium to create, delete, and extend life of most used labs in rol.redhat.com:
  - rh124-8.2
  - rh134-8.2
  - rh294-8.4
  - rh199-8.2 
  - do180-4.6
  - do280-4.6
  - do288-4.6

It has been implemented to be deployed with a simple ansible-plabook, ansible-navigator, or openshift.
You will now found the different setups, from the easiest one to the one that may need more root permissions on your laptop. 

## Using openshift

### Requisites
- An active subscription to rol.redhat.com
- oc client (optional)

### Setup
We can use the shared public cluster from the labs (DO180, DO288), although I'm not sure for how long the projects will persist before being pruned. 

This method only requires that you create a secret with your credentials and a cronjob that will launch the script weekly to keep your labs created.
``` 
$ oc login https://api.na46.prod.nextcle.com:6443 -u<generated_user> -p<generated_password>
$ oc new-project <name_it>
$ oc create secret generic rol-credentials --from-literal=username=yourusername@redhat.com --from-literal=password=yourpassword
$ oc create -f cronjobs/cronjobs.yml
``` 

## Using ansible

### Setup
Fill in the credentials.yml file with your rol.redhat.com credentials:
```
username: "youruser@redhat.com"
password: "yourpassword"
``` 

Customize the lab_environment and courses_id variables in the create/delete.yml vars section.
```
- name: ROL labs launcher
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files: credentials.yml
  vars:
    - lab_environment: rol 	# Valid options are: rol / rol-stage
    - course_id:  		# Get the course_id from the URL, such https://rol.redhat.com/rol/app/courses/rh124-8.2
        - rh124-8.2
        - rh134-8.2
        - rh294-8.4
        ...
```
#### Running with ansible-navigator

## Requisites
- podman (from Internal Software catalog, tab 6 - Development)
- ansible-navigator
```
pip3 install 'ansible-navigator[ansible-core]' --user
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
```

Run the playbook with ansible-navigator.
``` 
$ ansible-navigator run -m stdout create.yml

``` 

Remember you can override the variables without editing the yaml files by using the extra-vars parameter.
```
$ ansible-navigator run -m stdout delete.yml \ 
	-e 'lab_environment=rol-stage' \
	-e '{"course_id": ["rh124-8.2", "rh134-8.2"]}'
```

#### Running with ansible-playbook

##### Requisites
- Root access to your laptop
- ansible core
- python3
- selenium libraries
`pip3 install selenium`

Run the playbook with ansible-navigator.
``` 
$ ansible-playbook create.yml

``` 

## Recommendations
- The *create.yml* playbook will also increase the *Auto-destroy* box of the lab to the maximum available (usually 14 days). I recomend to create a cronjob that runs at least every 2 weeks.
- Sometimes labs get stuck and don't stop, so it's important to keep an eye on the *Lab hours used* counter to detect any abusive usage.
- Due to fast changes in lab environment during development phases of a course, I recommend a daily cronjob to create and delete the lab to start each day with a new fresh lab environment.
